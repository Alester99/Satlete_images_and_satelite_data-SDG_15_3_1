# Satlete_images_and_satelite_data-SDG_15_3_1

Here you can see the total code that was used for calculation of indicator SDG 15.3.1 based on geospatial and satellite data that was given by researches of Space Research Institute of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine and the State Space Agency of Ukraine.  

First sub-indicator is Productivity. For this classification map we need to count Productivity State, Productivity Trend, Productivity Perfomance. Productivity Total measures them in one degradation map of Productivity, that uses data such as NDVI for calculations.

Second sub-indicator is Land Cover Change. Here were used classification maps with crops of Ukraine from reserches of SRI of NASU and SSAU. For creating this maps table of migration from one classs to another was used.

Third sub-indicator is Coil Organic Change. It was a problem that only old data in small qualities was available. Space team solved this problem and createad a new approach and wrote an article on the topic of the decision.

Then all three sub-indicators were mergen in one degradation map of Ukraine.
